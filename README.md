### Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share
In this capstone project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis using various tools such as Excel, SQL, and Tableau to explore the data of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing company. By examining the patterns and behaviors of casual riders and annual members, I gained valuable insights into the usage of different bike types. With these insights in mind, I devised actionable plans to support the marketing team in their efforts to convert more casual riders into loyal members of Cyclistic. Through the implementation of visualizations and data-driven recommendations, I aimed to enhance the company's success by leveraging the strengths of each customer group and optimizing their experience with the service.

### Background
Cyclistic is an imaginary bike-sharing service operating in the Chicago area. With a fleet of more than 5,824 bicycles and over 600 stations, Cyclistic has successfully attracted a diverse customer base by targeting various consumer segments and providing a wide range of bike options to cater to all types of riders. In the system, casual riders have the option to purchase single or full-day passes, while members opt for annual passes. After conducting a financial analysis, it has been determined that annual members generate higher profits compared to casual riders. As a result, Cyclistic aims to increase the number of annual members in their customer base.
